# Introduction
Observer is a key tool that records the behaviour of running users, apps and services on a system under observation, with the objective that observed behaviour of these is used to detect anomalous behaviour in a production system.

When used along with enforcer, Aegis could be used either just to monitor and flag or to actively prevent anomalous behaviour on a production system.
